Welcome to CodPy's Documentation!
=================================

This site accompanies the book *CodPy: A Python Library for Numerics, Machine Learning, and Statistics*, available on `arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07084>`_ by Philippe G. LeFloch, Jean-Marc Mercier, and Shohruh Miryusupov. It provides code implementations and reproductions of the experiments detailed in the book using the CodPy library.

About CodPy
